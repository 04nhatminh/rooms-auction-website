Host rất thân thiện và tạo không gian thoải mái nên tụi mình đã rất tận hưởng chuyến đi Phú Yên lần này. Home ở gần trung tâm nên đi đâu cũng dễ, khu vực xung quanh yên tĩnh và chill. Chắc chắn đây là căn homestay tụi mình sẽ ghé lại khi đến Phú Yên <3"

Cô Tú chủ nhà siêu thân thiện, mỗi khi mình. nhắn tin cô trả lời nhanh lắm luôn í kể cả khuya rồi. Mình với bạn thấy thoải mái như ở nhà z, sân vườn đẹp rộng, thuận tiện di chuyển. Nói chung là nên ở đây nếu mọi người muốn cảm giác thoải mái như ở nhà. Sau mình đi Phú yên mình vẫn sẽ ở đây. Bọn mình có giặt đồ với phơi đồ, cô mang lên tận phòng giúp chúng mình luôn. Siêu tuyệt vời!!"

There is also a garden and a parking slot if you travel by car, although you can park outside too. I really like how responsive and welcoming the host is - Ms. Tú is very friendly and always helps us whenever we need support. I can't think of any other place that matches the service and quality for this price range - definitely a place to stay and enjoy.<br/>P/s: I also love the guidebook Ms. Tú put in the room. I did not know that tuna can be made into 101 dishes."

Không gian rộng rãi, thoải mái và được dọn dẹp sạch sẽ trước khi chúng tôi đến. <br/>Tuy nhiên, địa chỉ trên Airbnb không đúng với địa chỉ thực tế, khiến việc tìm kiếm gặp khó khăn. Khi tôi gọi điện lần đầu tiên, phía host không thông báo địa chỉ chính xác, khiến gia đình tôi phải tự tìm đường. Sau đó, một người host khác mới gọi lại để hướng dẫn cụ thể. <br/>Ánh sáng trong nhà hơi yếu, khiến bé nhỏ của tôi có chút e ngại. Gia đình tôi đã quyết định chuyển qua ở khách sạn gần đó vì cảm thấy đồ đạc trong nhà khá cũ và không phù hợp với nhu cầu. Tuy nhiên, đây chỉ là cảm nhận cá nhân của chúng tôi, và nơi này có thể sẽ phù hợp với các gia đình khác."

The room was clean, well furnished with all the basics, and while it’s part of a family home, the guest area is separate. The patio was also nice to hang out in during the evening. Perfect location, just 2 mins from the beach with lots of food options around. Exactly what I needed for a short break."
