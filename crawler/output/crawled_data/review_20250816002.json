I went for a visa, and had to purchase a visa to enter vietnam to obtain a visa for indonesia so i wasn’t really happy with going to vietnam in the first place and not happy about the system in general but i tried to make the best of it. never met chon. maybe just AI for the staff to use. It was clean and worked. nothing was wrong with the place."

Resolved after it got that bad.<br/>Karaoke bar that runs til 2300 every night.<br/>Window shades in disrepair and almost non-functional, told front desk, informed all were slated for repair.  No change while there.<br/>No bathroom products except toilet paper, and a pump bottle of soap with a broken pump, had to pour it in to our hands when showering.<br/>Housekeeping, cleaned the room but never changed the sheets entire stay, 11 nights.  [We made note of a stain to ensure this is accurate.]<br/>No hot water for 2 nights with no notice.  <br/>Motor bike rental, the bike shwed up almost bone dry for fuel.  Gas gauge flashing warning about low fuel.<br/>None of this was anything Cong could have done anything about so we never bothered him."

This place is in the center of the city, 3mins walk straight to the beach. You've got my recommendation 👌"

A lot of space, 2 bedrooms with 2 bathrooms, a wonderfully-equipped kitchen (if you need something extra, you'll be given it nearly immediately) and a balcony with a  beautiful view of the sea to the left and the whole city to the right. The location was also perfect. You should have just crossed the road to get to the beach with soft warm sand. There were a lot of places around to eat or buy anything you wanted. And if you decided to get to the center, a taxi (or a scooter) was right at the enterance at any time.<br/>The host is very hospitable and easy to get. <br/>Highly recommended!"

Steve som värd var mycket lätt att kommunicera med, vi kom till Nha Trang flera timmar innan incheckning men vi kunde lämna väskorna i huset.<br/>Det var en underbar utsikt och boendet låg precis vid stranden där vi spenderade den mesta av tiden. Boendet ligger lite utanför Nha Trang centrum men vi gillade det då stranden är lite mer lugn än den stora stranden i centrum. Om vi ville in i staden tog vi bara en Grab som brukade kosta runt 50.000-70VND per sträcka. I området finns det många bra fisk och skaldjursrestauranger och även en stor matbutik i huset. <br/>Man får det man betalar för när det gäller boendet, avloppet i köket luktade lite konstig och det fanns myror som kröp runt. I ett av rummen hade lakanen små fläckar som vi tror var av blod. Det fanns även ingen soptunna i köket och ett av badrummen. Vårt hisskort funkade inte i alla hissar heller. <br/>Men den ”problemen” vi hade är små och hela upplevelsen väger upp. Skulle rekommendera Steves boende!"

More likely to get decent (+ cheaper) local food & goods here.<br/>Exactly like photos, spectacular view, 23rd flr, spacious, v clean, v quiet.  Building felt safe + respectable, lifts clean and fast to arrive. Communal area clean.<br/>Kitchen skmply furnished e.g. some dishes, bowls, cutlery, and 2 mugs. Kettle + coffee machine, too.  Huge, very clean fridge. Dish soap & cleaning cloth provided, but no tea towels.  Full size 4-seat dining table.<br/>Great shower, no leaking, turn on hot water 10 minutes before, shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, hand soap, decent thick towels (two per person) and reasonably strong hair dryer.  Lots of toilet tissue given.<br/>Washing machine great to freshen up clothes, Air conditioners and the standing fan operated flawlessly.<br/>Hosts polite, extremely responsive and helpful; they have these detailed, clear digital guides on how to check in, how to find the place, etc which were really helpful."

(튜브, 비치볼, 유아용 암튜브 있음)<br/>4. 시내와 가까운 조용한 동네라 너무너무 마음에 들었습니다. 시내는 그랩타고 10분 내외거리입니다.<br/>5. 도보 3~4분 거리에 한인마트 있어용 가격도 착해서 여기 매일 갔습니다.<br/>6. 아침에 바로 앞 골목에서 반미랑 찹쌀이 들어간 빵을 팔아요. 특히 찹쌀 들어간 빵이 되게 고소하고 달달하니 경험해보세요.(배탈 안났고, 바로 옆 길거리 커피도 맛집)<br/>7. 모든 방, 거실, 주방에 에어컨이 있습니다. <br/>8. 최고 장점: 공항 픽업, 샌딩 서비스가 다른곳에 비해 절반 가격!"

Nên thuê xe máy để di chuyển cho thuận tiện. Từ khu này vào trung tâm phải đi tầm 10p. Checkin dễ. Có thể đi ô tô vào tới tận cửa nhà. <br/>Nội thất thiết kế đẹp. Tầng 1 có bồn tắm ngoài vườn và bếp ngoài vườn. Tầng 2 có bồn tắm trong nhà. Mấy hôm mình ở thì trời mưa nên không sử dụng được bồn và bếp ngoài trời. Host trả lời tin nhắn nhanh."

Matches the photos exactly!! This host has such a keen eye for small details, lighting, angles and was so responsive and nice to message. I’m so impressed! <br/>The projectors are such a smart and homely touch that we loved. So many great coffee shops nearby. Really private location tucked away such great location for money and it’s clear to see you are supporting someone really passionate about creating an experience for their guests! 💖"

At first we thought we were too far out from the main centre, but once we discovered the GRAB taxi ap, the location was perfect...several little coffee shops 2 minutes away. Very close to sea. Lovely and quiet at night. More of an authentic feel than the hotels. Grocery shop near by. Loved it, loved it, loved it. A highlight in our Vietnam trip, and that's saying something."

Of the minuses: the Internet often disappears for a few seconds, but in general it works well, there is no clothes dryer, hand soap. Otherwise, I did not hear the noise of the neighbors, a beautiful view from the balcony, many establishments nearby. + you can leave your car or moped in the underground parking."

The location couldn’t be better: beach, mall, shops – everything just a few minutes away.<br/>But the real highlight? Helen. She made the stay perfect. Always available, super responsive, and took care of even the tiniest issues. What really blew me away: she helped me out with a private issue without hesitation. I had to order a new router, and she just handled it. 🙏🏼❤️ Thank you, Helen!"

We asked for some essential kitchen supplies prior to our visit and she prepared everything which was really kind of her. I would like to point out that the bed was super comfy and the bedding was delightfully soft (it was mega important for us because we stayed in the hotel for 20 days and if the bedlinen got coarse and skin irritable due to harsh chemical whitening it would have been very uncomfortable, specially when we came along with our 6-year old kid). <br/>The location of the hotel is in the heart of Nha Trang that offers variety of foods. Beach was only across the street which we were happy about. <br/>Cleanness of the hotel is good. Free of any tropical insects that can be a nasty problem. I would highly recommend the room and thankful for the hostess. Would stay here again."

The only reason why it’s not a five star is that the hot water took two hours to heat up after we had to turn on the hot water heater because it was too overcast forthe solar. Also, there is not a dryer for the laundry."

There's a small kitchen, perfect for making something light like breakfast if you want to. The beach is very close, just a few minutes' walk, and the night market is also nearby.<br/>The only small downside (though it wasn't a problem for us) was the queue for the elevator. It's a common issue in this building, likely due to its great location and affordable prices."

Surrounding stores was open 24/7. Easy to get to restaurants and or anything in the surrounding areas. Night market is next door so that was a plus for us too. The kids loved that. Night life was so enjoyable. We would definitely come back and visit same place again and most likely come for a longer stay. 5 days was not long enough. <br/>Host was fast at responding and could have transportation to and from the place so that is a PLUS!!!!! I recommend."

The location is also great, just a short walk to the beach and close to restaurants and local markets.<br/>What really made the experience stand out was Annie’s warmth and hospitality. She was incredibly helpful and responsive, always ready to answer any questions and provide local tips. Her kindness made me feel very welcome and comfortable during my stay.<br/>I highly recommend Annie’s place to anyone visiting Nha Trang — whether you’re staying for a few days or longer, you’ll feel right at home here. Thank you so much, Annie!"

Chị chủ siêu tâm lý và nhiệt tình sẵn sàng hỗ trợ khi mình cần, không gian tuy nhỏ nhắn nhưng lại rất thoáng đãng, sạch sẽ, nằm ở vị trí sát biển, không quá xa trung tâm, rất thích hợp cho bạn nào du lịch nghỉ dưỡng. Chắc chắn sẽ quay lại đây ^^"

The property was big, beautiful and we felt right at home. Grocery store, convenience stores, cafes and restaurants literally steps from the building. And the beach is across the street (and much more clean and relaxing than in the town center). Honestly, we loved the property and location so much that we only went downtown once and spent most of our time exploring this great neighbourhood. I can’t recommend Thao’s Air BnB enough. Would give 10 stars if I could!"

The apartment is well decorated, neat and clean.<br/>Thao even offered a small gift before I checked out and I really appreciate the gift. <br/>I will definitely book Thao's apartment again if I'm back to NT. <br/>Overall, this apartment is highly recommended."

They helped us with all requests including transport onto our next destination. <br/>The photos are accurate of the listing. It is very clean, comfortable beds, great spaces to chill out in the living room and balcony. It is very easy to feel at home here- basic kitchen to allow you to make breakfast and store food. AC in each room and offers of extra services eg cleaning throughout the stay. I’m sure if you had any additional requests Thao would be more than willing to assist you in any way. <br/>As stated in the listing it isn’t in a central location. However, this wasn’t an issue as it is seconds away from the beach and a supermarket. It was very easy to make our own way into town by walk (40mins-1hr) or by taxi (10-15min). <br/>I would recommend this listing for anyone staying in Nha Trang! Exceeded all expectations."

Thao ist eine hervorragende Gastgeberin, die sich um weit mehr gekümmert hat als nur darum, dass die Gäste ankommen. <br/>Ich kann die Wohnung wirklich für jeden empfehlen, der das Glück hat die Wohnung noch nicht ausgebucht vorzufinden :)"

The house was not only clean and comfortable but also beautifully styled—every detail reflected care and taste, which made the experience feel extra special. I really appreciated the warm and thoughtful touches throughout the space. Cam Van was also a kind and responsive host, making everything smooth from check-in to check-out. I would definitely recommend this accommodation to anyone visiting the area!"

Thanks. <br/>Scope for improvement - would be nice to have detergent for washing machine.

Apparently they painted the walls right before my check in.. and the room was not properly aired. As a result, for the 2 nights that I slept there I had to breathe that horrible chemical smell of some cheap paint...Somehow, I survived. Yet, people with more sensitive lungs or respiratory issues might not be so lucky. Besides the smell, the room wasn't really cleaned well. Tones of hair on the floor.. mixed with dust. My soles were charcoal-black after 10 mins in that room..  The location and the room itself is still fine for the price. Lack of proper management though, is what makes me to rate it -  2/5."

You can walk virtually everywhere. <br/>The only disappointing thing is (which is absolutely my own fault for not looking more closely at the pictures) was that I wasn't facing the beach. Ben did not at any time advise this, but it's worth noting that the apartment looks over the mountains and city (which is still a great view!)."

When we came back to the hotel the staff told me that someone was waiting for me to give me my phone. This person asked me for a lot of money to get my phone back. The building staff refused to help or to give me the camera footage of the person who extort me. We left the accommodation earlier than expected because we didn’t feel safe anymore. When leaving, the building staff refused to give us our caution for the access cards. We had the cards but they wanted us to give the paper that we received a week prior with the cards…. Paper that was at the bottom of my luggage, and I wasn’t gonna go open my luggage in the lobby. All in all, not a good experience"

Wir waren kurzzeitig ausgesperrt, und Ben konnte das Problem nach kurzer Kommunikation beheben und wir konnten auf das Zimmer. Im Vergleich zum Lärm in Saigon, war es im Zimmer leise 🥹 top Preis-Leistungsverhältnis! Für deutsche Gäste auch zu empfehlen, da Ben auch Deutsch kann. Immer wieder gern!"

Getting around was super easy, making my stay even more enjoyable.<br/>The room was spotless and offered a great view. The host was incredibly attentive, even providing an extra towel which came in handy for my daily beach trips. Their thoughtfulness truly made my stay special.<br/>I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Nha Trang. You won’t be dissapointed!"

I had a bit of trouble with my keypad on the door dieing, the hotel staff immediately fixed it. perfect location, can't stress that enough. it's the center of everything. the host was great, check in was easy and very luxurious for the price. I really can't believe how cheap it was for the quality of the room. if I'm in Nha trang again, I won't bother to look anywhere else for my stay."

В квартире не было ни тараканов, ни любой другой живности. 2 туалета и 2 душевых. Если хозяева поменяют матрасы, мы с радостью останемся там снова:) также я посоветовала бы купить капсульную кофемашину и посудомойку."

The main beach of Nha Trang is footsteps away from the building.  It’s a great place to swim.  There are a lot of other attractions that are just a short walk away.  There is even an indoor shopping mall and Nha Trang’s biggest grocery store in the same building.  Basically you’re getting everything you would get at one of the nearby resorts at a fraction of the price.  Book this place if you’re lucky enough to see that it is available.  I really enjoyed my stay and hope to come back soon!"

          "comments": "I kinda feel reluctant to leave this review just in case more others rush to this hidden gem in Nha Trang and then booking is getting hard for me.  But it’s a MUST stay if you look for somewhere like a wild judge vibe but also enjoy a comfy stay. This is a two floors apartment and I stayed at ground floor this time. Room is spacious and everything in an Ancient Greek style deco. There’s a kitchen and mini pool in the yard for share with other guests on first floor. U can enjoy an outdoor shower and dipping in the pool by those tropical plants which was exactly what I’ve been doing and taking lots good vibed photos. This place is quiet too but not far from main road and beach. A mini mart is around the corner too. And the host is super nice when I found body wash in short, the host came to my rescue in person within 10 mins. Overall it’s defiantly a paradise and also an important reason I would like to revisit Nha Trang."

There is no better feeling when opening the door and is blasted with arctic cold air. The unit is as described; we felt at home. There are 3 bedrooms with 2 baths. The beach is a 3 minute walk, the night market is close by, and so is everything else, food , snacks or shops.  Celine’s place is a great value for the money. We will be back."

Great ocean views and bright and airy. The place was comfortable with the comfiest beds we’ve had in a while in Vietnam! The place was in good condition and as pictured. The block itself was nice and clean and welcoming. The host was responsive and helpful. We’d definitely stay again!"

Nhưng co những khoản phí rất là vô lý, phí giữ xe là một ví dụ nhưng mình có thể thông cảm vì du lịch, nhưng phí sử dụng xe trolley là vô lí nhất, mình đã bỏ tiền ra du lịch thì tính toán chi việc nhỏ nhặt, nhưng thái độ của nhân viên làm mình không hài lòng. Mình đi du lịch thì sử dụng airbnb rất nhiều nhưng đây là lần trải nghiệm tệ nhất."

При заселении и выезде предоставляют комнату для багажа, также есть мыло и другие мелочи, полезные в первые дни. Расположение крутое и даже в квартире без вида на море есть окно с таким видом.<br/>Теперь о плохом: балконы не убирают, с 8 до 20 в квартире напротив делали шумный ремонт и в коридор был очень грязный. Полотенца крайне уставшие, в тумбочках под телевизором живут мини-муравьи.<br/>Жилье крайне сильно нуждается в косметическом ремонте, в каждой комнате есть место, которое нужно подкрасить, потолок или уголок стены. Нам не показалось это затратным и удивило почему это не было сделано для привлекательного состояния жилья. Самым обидным была ванная в гостинной - там не было стекла у душа и вода заливала всю комнату, мы попросили хотябы занавеску или ремонт, нам предложили экстра полотенца для самостоятельной уборки. Это ок, но нас расстроило отношение.<br/>Вариант на один раз."

It was so nice to have coffee in the morning and watch the city and the sea. The place was very clean and tidy when we arrived. For the price, it's a really good deal. The location is perfect - you can walk to the beach, the night market, and a ton of different restaurants and cafes. Highly recommend it if you're looking for a great spot in Nha Trang."

It was private, clean, with an excellent view, and surrounded by tourist facilities (massage, restaurants, spa, etc.) Elevators could be a little slow, but that’s to be expected with any large hotel. Definitely worth the price to book here!"

There were some insects on the wall over the bed (harmless and probably there because of humidity) and we had to remove them every night before sleeping. The host was responsive and always tried to help but it seemed like the cleaning stuff was not collaborating. We wouldn’t come back."

The major problem is the super packed panorama building where you have to wait for the elevator for up to 20 minutes, like host stated.<br/>If you’re okay with loads of tourists and families its a good choice, but if you want something more relaxing, consider another place.<br/>Main issue was the defensive communication of the host, instead of listening to the complains and try stretch to meet the guest needs, the host just takes a very defensive position and tried to find excuses. We were also left without answers and had to contact airbnb to get in contact with the host.<br/>We cancelled the stay after 2 nights and will unfortunately not return."

However, I did have an issue with cleanliness — there was a visible mark on the blanket/sheet when I arrived. I raised this with the host right away, but unfortunately, their response came across as quite defensive and dismissive, rather than helpful or understanding. I wasn’t expecting luxury, just basic cleanliness and respectful communication. I hope this feedback is taken constructively, as the experience could have been much better with a more professional approach."

Căn hộ sạch sẽ, các trang thiết bị hoạt động tốt, host có chuẩn bị những thứ cơ bản như nước uống, kem đánh răng, bàn ủi, máy sấy tóc.<br/>2. Ai thích náo nhiệt, ngay trung tâm quảng trường, chợ đêm thì đây là lựa chọn hoàn hảo (nhưng nếu bạn thích yên tĩnh thì music từ chợ đêm là thứ bạn phải cân nhắc)<br/>2. Điểm trừ duy nhất là thủ tục check in và thang máy của tòa nhà chờ quá lâu. nhưng đây là yếu tố host khó can thiệp.<br/>Tóm lại đây là 1 lựa chọn ko tồi nếu có discount 🙂"

Nihan was very responsive and we were able to extend our stay easily.<br/>Unfortunately the hotel (panorama) the apartment is located in is quite poorly run. The lifts often took up to 10-15 mins just get to/from the room. They were often overcrowded and quite slow. Despite this, several lifts weren't operating and the sky deck had a lift reserved for them. Also the gym doesn't open until 8am for an unknown reason. The gym facilities were reasonable. However there were pilates machines behind a locked door in the gym and when we asked there was no way to access them (not even a way to pay for access). The free pool also closes at 5pm also for unknown reasons which was disappointing."

          "comments": "J’ai passé deux semaines dans ce logement. Au premier abord il est fidèle aux photos. <br/>Voici selon moi les points positifs et négatifs : <br/>- Points positifs : très belle vue, grande superficie, très bon emplacement, salle de sport gratuite dans le bâtiment. <br/>- Points négatifs : j’ai remarqué qu’il y avait une odeur de renfermé qui a mon avis est dû à la très forte humidité dans l’appartement. J’ai l’odorat développé donc cela m’a dérangé. De plus il faut payer des frais supplémentaires pour le ménage. Il y avait également des fourmis, j’ai du acheter un produit, cela était dérangeant. Et enfin le grand lit est en réalité deux petits lits collés et ça se sentait avec une démarcation au milieu. À cause de l’humidité, les draps du lits étaient aussi parfois humides et vu qu’ils ne sont pas changés tous les jours, c’était dérangeant pour moi. <br/>En conclusion je recommande ce logement pour quelques jours seulement, mais pas pour une longue durée car il y a trop de points négatifs selon moi"

Апартаменты новые, очень чистые и ухоженные — находиться в них было по-настоящему приятно.<br/>Квартира отлично оснащена: есть вся необходимая техника — аэрогриль, рисоварка, хорошая стиральная машина, холодильник с ледогенератором, утюг, гладильная доска, множество посуды, кастрюль и кухонных принадлежностей. Всё продумано до мелочей — чувствуешь себя как дома.<br/>С балкона открывается потрясающий вид на море, а из окна — живописные горы. Особенно красиво по утрам, когда встаёт солнце.<br/>Отдельное спасибо хозяйке — очень доброжелательная, внимательная и чуткая. Было приятно общаться, чувствовалась искренняя забота о нашем комфорте.<br/>Смело рекомендуем это жильё и с удовольствием вернёмся снова!"

Nhà lúc nào cũng thơm nhẹ nhàng, tạo cảm giác thư giãn ngay khi bước vào.<br/>🏠 Về tiện nghi:<br/>Đầy đủ thiết bị, từ bếp, máy giặt đến máy sấy tóc, máy nước nóng, v.v.<br/>Không gian rộng rãi – thoải mái, thích hợp cho gia đình. <br/>🎀 Đặc biệt, chị chủ nhà siêu dễ thương và chu đáo, hỗ trợ nhanh chóng và nhiệt tình từ lúc đặt phòng đến khi check-out.<br/>Rất hài lòng và chắc chắn sẽ quay lại nếu có dịp.<br/>Một chốn dừng chân dễ thương cho những ai muốn tìm sự yên bình giữa lòng Nha Trang 💛"

It is a very popular location therefore the was a lot people and the elevators can be very annoying since everyone packs into them and if you’re on one do the upper levels it can take up to 10 minutes to get your floor.   There also could be a wait for the elevators as well."

I’ve read a lot of reviews of the hotel and other airbnbs and there is a problem with a mildew smell from the plumbing. It didn’t bother us as we knew to expect it from reading reviews and just opening the balcony for a few minutes freshens the room up. <br/>The location is good, we didn’t use any of the hotel facilities as I believe you have to pay? but it was perfect for going to the beach which was our main activity! <br/>I would stay again, as viewing the other options nearby this view and location is superior in my opinion."

There were some broken appliances, and the pictures from Airbnb were not exactly 100% truthful however, the view was absolutely amazing and after some time the host became more and more responsive, so if I had to give this a solid rating, I would give it 3.5 stars. It was in a very convenient location. Everything was easily accessible the beach, food, clubs, etc. I would stay again, but I would ask that it was a little more paid attention to when it came to being cleaned and well kept."

Chủ nhà cũng rất dễ thương và tận tình, hỗ trợ tôi 24/24. Nhất định tôi sẽ quay lại căn hộ của bạn ở lần tiếp theo khi tôi đến Nha Trang!"

Chú bảo vệ dưới toà nhà cũng thân thiện và hỗ trợ mình gửi xe theo ngày để đỡ tốn tiền nữa. Điểm mình ưng nhất là view từ ban công rất đẹp, rộng và thoáng. Mình đã dành gần như cả ngày ở căn hộ để chill. Rất recommend mọi người đến căn hộ và trải nghiệm."

L’appartement était impeccable, très bien équipé et offrait une vue magnifique sur la mer. La décoration moderne et soignée nous a immédiatement mis à l’aise, et tout était parfaitement propre à notre arrivée.<br/>L’emplacement est idéal : à quelques minutes seulement de la plage, des restaurants et des commerces. Nous avons pu tout faire à pied, ce qui était très pratique. Le quartier est calme tout en étant proche de l’animation de la ville.<br/>Un grand merci à notre hôte, qui a été très réactif et toujours disponible pour répondre à nos questions. Ses recommandations sur les endroits à visiter et les bonnes adresses locales nous ont été précieuses.<br/>Nous recommandons sans hésitation cet Airbnb et espérons y revenir lors de notre prochaine visite à Nha Trang !"

The views from each room are spectacular—city and Mountain views from the guest bedroom and city, mountain, and ocean views from the primary bedroom and living room. The host was very helpful with a few of our questions and provided assistance right away. Would definitely stay here again!"

The space is immaculately clean, airy, and spacious, with plenty of natural light and a calming sea view that made every morning feel like a fresh beginning.<br/>The beds were comfortable — supportive mattresses that gave us such good rest, which is often hard to find when traveling. The location is super convenient, just a short stroll to the beach and surrounded by everything we needed.<br/>But what truly made the experience special was the host. Exceptionally kind, attentive, and warm, they went out of their way to ensure we had a smooth and relaxing stay.<br/>Highly recommended for anyone looking for a peaceful and well-cared-for home in the heart of Nha Trang 💛"

Căn hộ được decor trang nhã, dễ chịu và phù hợp cho gia đình có 2 con. Có 1 số điểm nhỏ mình chưa ưng ý như nhà vệ sinh có mùi hôi cống, hầm đậu xe cũng hôi cống nhưng đây là điều có thể thông cảm được cho 1 tòa nhà mới hoàn thiện. Ngoài ra toà nhà khu căn hộ nằm trong 1 khu phố rất yên tĩnh, bao bọc bởi rất nhiều quán cf và quán ăn ngon trong bán kính 1km. Nói chung, với ưu điểm vượt trội so với nhược điểm thì gia đình mình chắc chắn sẽ quay lại vào lần sau."

Thao님의 감성이 숙소 모든 물건에서 묻어나옵니다.<br/>손님이 머물면서 뭐가 필요할까?를 고민한 흔적들이 느껴집니다.<br/>그리고 가장 중요한것은 5성급호텔, 리조트도 따라오지 못하는 명품 바다뷰입니다. 해돋이, 일몰, 낮 풍경은 그 어디서도 보지 못하는 최고의 풍경입니다.<br/>방문할때마다 똑같은 장소에서 사진을 찍지만 매번 새로운 사진이 탄생해서 나 자신도 놀라고 감동받습니다.<br/>베트남여행 7년동안 풍경, 인생샷 사진은 모두 Thao님 숙소에서 찍은것 같습니다.<br/>그동안 우리가족을 위해서 최선을 다 해준 Thao님께 진심으로 감사드리며 Thao님을 적극 추천합니다."

The ocean view was breathtaking—it was so beautiful that I found myself staring out the window for hours. But the best part was the host, who was truly one of the kindest and warmest people I’ve ever met. Their hospitality made me feel completely at home. Honestly, this stay was even better than any 5-star hotel I’ve experienced. I would come back in a heartbeat. 10/10, highly recommended!"

The homestay has an incredible view — waking up to the ocean and city skyline was just breathtaking. Right next door is an infinity pool that feels like you're swimming into the horizon — perfect for morning dips or sunset chills.<br/>The host was super friendly and responsive, always ready to help us out. She even let us store our luggage in the room after check-out, which was so convenient and thoughtful.<br/>If we ever come back to Nha Trang, this will definitely be our go-to place. Highly recommended for anyone looking for comfort, great vibes, and that perfect view!"

We could get some of our basic Groceries right across the street and a winmart just around the corner.<br/> Moon milk market within a 15 minute walk. A huge local market downtown was an experience to go and see even if you didn't buy anything there. Anna always responded to our questions and was very helpful. There were many restaurants within Walking distance of our building all of them that we visited were very good. We would definitely recommend this place for anybody visiting Vietnam."

For us the location, away from the mass tourism spots down by the Lotus building, was a big attraction, The area around the building - the restaurants, bars and locals, seemed far more genuine in this location and we loved the vibe.<br/>The apartment does not disappoint in any way, the view from the balcony constantly changes depending on time of day, daylight and lighting - we never tired of sitting on the balcony, early morning, late afternoon or nightcap time - wonderful. The apartment was spotlessly clean, very well maintained, equipped to a high standard, had a fantastic fridge/freezer and very effective a/c. The bathroom again was very well maintained and has the best walk-in waterfall shower head I have experienced. The bed is huge and extremely comfortable.<br/>We did not hear any sound from neighbouring apartments, it was nice to have a 24hr concierge presence in the lobby.<br/>We will return to Anna's again."

First of all, I booked the room very late at night, around dawn, but Cong still responded and confirmed my reservation, which I greatly appreciated. Additionally, I was able to check in as early as 4:40 AM thanks to the 24-hour reception.<br/>Later, I realized that unfortunately, the pool on the 15th floor wasn’t operational. I mentioned that it was quite important to me, and they very kindly upgraded me to an even better room with an ocean view. Cong and the reception staff were extremely helpful, kind, and spoke English, which isn’t always common in Vietnam.<br/>Since I needed a late checkout, they allowed me to stay longer without any extra charges, which was another notable and kind gesture.<br/>Overall, it’s a 10/10 experience for me – the location, cleanliness, and staff were all excellent. I genuinely recommend this place to everyone. If I return to Nha Trang, I’ll definitely stay here again and"

Hotel is just next to the coast and beach but hidden from main street and therefore - silence during the day and night!<br/>Wi-Fi speed is more than enough for everyday usage: stable 50Mb/s upload and download (according to Speed App, but my Steam download peaked at 460 Mb/s and 110GB of content downloaded in 30 minutes!)<br/>And most important - sense of peaceful and kindness from amazing staff. Wonderfull and warm Việt Nam and Tâm are ready to support any moment or help you start the day with delicious breakfast and smile. (Nhi the dog <3)<br/>Motorbike parking at the spot, laundry smelling like spring, local surfing spot just 5 minutes from the hotel, and gateway from the city into mountains trails or ferry to islands.<br/>Perfect location and highest comfort. Feels more like homely stay than generic hotel service. Thank you! <3"

На 6 этаже тренажерный зал, на 40 бассейн видовой. Это нужно обязательно увидеть. <br/>Вначале возникло недопонимание из-за форс-мажора ( к приезду номер не был готов, потому что жилец заболел и не съехал, попав в больницу), но нас заселили в другой номер. Хочется заехать и отдыхать спокойно, но пришлось переезжать из номера в номер, через пару дней мы уже заселились в свой номер. <br/>Но на этом все недопонимания закончились и мы прекрасно отдохнули. <br/>Единственный нюанс, который вы отметите в «Панораме»- ожидание лифта. Здание 40 этажное, много отдыхающих, 5-10 мин на процесс. Однако, это не относится к самому жилью, так как оно безупречное. <br/>Минь отзывчивая и внимательная. Помогала во всех вопросах, консультировала и всегда была на связи. <br/>Спасибо за великолепный отпуск. Если будем еще, то только у этого хозяина."

Short walk to the beach, great area with lots of restaurants and massages, stores in walking distance. Can highly recommend. Communication with Minh was quick and easy. Only negative points: might get noisy at night time due to its central location and there’s regularly a queue for the elevators due to the building size, although 10 elevators are available."

It was furnished with all of the necessary amenities that one might need, decorated in a clean and stylish fashion and boasted a bed that was especially comfortable. Not to mention access to a washing machine on the balcony that overlooks the ocean! The location itself is convenient to many groceries, restaurants, pharmacies, etc and is only 5-10 minutes away by motorbike to the main centre of the city. Because of this, there still maintains a sense of peacefulness to the general locality. The hosts were gracious, extremely communicative and were helpful in any way that they could be. They do offer an airport taxi service to and from the apartment for you to avail should you wish. This apartment would be a lovely stay for any guest in Nha Trang for their holiday retreat!"

          "comments": "Very much enjoyed my month long stay at Tram Anh’s place in Nha Trang. Communications were friendly and always helpful. I had an issue with the electronic keypad for the door during my stay(dead battery), and it was fixed promptly.<br/>The location is in a high-rise condo building north of the city center with many Russians. It can get a bit crazy with the amount of tourists there, so be prepared. As I had a motorbike, it was easy to get around. If you are without transportation, Grab will be your best friend. Decent beach right at your doorstep as well.<br/>The unit was simple and comfortable. A great cooking environment that complimented the living space. Balcony with a view of the water. Quality washing machine. Comfy bed in the bedroom. The window to the hallway leaked light until 4am, so be aware of that.<br/>The major downside was the bathroom. Small, no ventilation, and always a slight smell from the floor drain. Hot water was hit or miss.<br/>All in all, I really enjoyed my time here."

Communication with host’s was good , I good quick response to every query. They even help to drop off my luggage at their home as I arrived in Nha Trang very early in the morning and allowed early checking as well. Studio apartment was on 27th floor with good view of the bay from the balcony super clean  and it comes with all the amenities mentioned in the listing. Definitely recommend to fellow travellers."

The host was waiting for me to check-in, and was proactive in responding to all my messages. They were also very supportive of me during my stay, letting me extend my checkout time by a good two hours to allow me to take an official call.  I definitely recommend this place! :)"

Perfect for catching the sunrise in the morning or taking a relaxing evening stroll with the sound of the waves. So peaceful and refreshing! It has a simple but super cozy tropical style. Soft colors, lots of greenery, and even a small yard where you can sip coffee or read in the morning. It’s not fancy or luxury but everything is clean, well-arranged, and gives off a really homey vibe. One of the best parts was the host Linh so friendly and helpful! From booking to check-in, everything went smoothly. They gave great local tips on where to eat and explore. It really felt like getting advice from a local friend.  All in all, if you’re looking for a peaceful stay near the beach with a warm, tropical feel, I totally recommend this place. Would definitely come back next time!"

Quel dommage que tout soit laissé à l’abandon et qu’il n’y ai pas de réel entretien ni de suivi. <br/>Nous avons louer ce bien pour une durée de 3 semaines qui était bien localisé près de nos proches famille mais malgré notre arrivée tardive le ménage n’avait pas été effectué dans la maison, il y avait des morceaux d’emballages, cheveux, miettes de chips, poussière et saletés un peu partout dans la maison. Nous avons dû faire le ménage derrière les précédents locataires !<br/>Le frigo pour une maison prévu pour 8 personnes était tout petit, vétuste et cassé ! <br/>Le coin cuisine était très sale.<br/>Aucun coin salle à manger ni table ni chaises donc autant vous dire que nous n’avons pas pu cuisiner dans cette maison. Le bien ne correspondait ni au normes d’hygiène ni de sécurité pour le prix que nous avions payé, de plus l’hôte est de mauvaise foi nous avons écourté notre séjour et avons été chassé en pleine nuit avec nos deux bébés, abusé !!!!!"

Quick to respond. location has great taxi services we ended up turning off the grab app. there was a big incident with a drunk grab driver who picked us up. the place had its own taxi service connection that took care of us. the host got in touch with security there to safely bring us back safely. we will never take grab again in Nha Trang until they improve the google maps listing and the rude drivers out there. but hotel taxi service is 100x worth it here. all around we were impressed with our stay. the place was clean and smelled brand new. the view from the top was nothing short of breath taking. we will be coming back to rent from the host again next time we come back to Nha Trang."

Grab bike to city centre about 35,000 vnd/way. Tours charge extra for this location.<br/>Facilities: You can dry clothes on the rooftop. Hot water in my room 201  was by luck. Before 8pm, I could get hot water. But afterwards, only cold water. <br/>Room cleanness: One room cleaning/week for free. In my experience, I only asked for once and never ever again. Why? Hygiene problems! The cleaner used the brush to clean the toilet bowl first, then the plate. And no proper cleaning for the mop.<br/>Comfort: Their billboard flashes and disturbs sleep at night even with the curtain closed. <br/>Noise: There was always \"noise\" from local couples during weekends. And the dogs keep barking from early morning til midday. <br/>The manager Ashley was very nice and helpful and the only person who can speak English here. The owners are bad though"

Die Kommunikation mit Quang war sehr gut, er reagierte immer sehr schnell. Er organisierte sogar extra einen Hochstuhl für unser jüngstes Kind, was uns sehr gefreut hat und auf Anfrage auch weitere Tassen.<br/>Die Aussicht ist echt großartig und der Stadtstrand ist sehr nah, man muss quasi nur 1 Straße überqueren. Die Wohnung ist sehr sauber und auch geräumig. 2 Badezimmer sind sehr praktisch, genauso wie die Einkaufsmöglichkeiten direkt neben der Unterkunft. Die touristische Mischung ist interessant, da viele Touristen aus dem osteuropäischen bzw. eurasischen Raum herkommen. Während unseres Aufenthalts war der Strand super für unsere kleinen Kinder geeignet, da wenig Wellen waren.<br/>Wir können die Unterkunft empfehlen."

The open area is amazing with a pool, bbq, huge kitchen and a great view to Vinpearl and the fireworks which takes place there. 3 rooms have the same sea view as the pool, others two - garden view. Every morning we had fresh breakfast with fruits and cleaners if needed. Le responded quickly to all our requests. Thanks a lot to Le for our amazing time in Nha Trang. I would love to come back!"

It’s extremely spacious and clean with beautiful views of Vinpearl at night. The host Le offers complimentary breakfast and drinks daily with an extensive menu. She has 24/7 staff always on hand and is super responsive to everything. I told her that I was i celebrating my birthday for the trip and we walked into the place and saw birthday decorations with a complimentary cake on the inside. She even had cut fruits, water bottles and cleaning service daily. If you can, make sure to pay for her private BBQ service for dinner, it is worth it!!"

We walked to the local convenience store for a few times down the hill. Grab is so convenient at Nha Trang and you can go anywhere with Grab. The location is private and safe. Le also organised seafood dinner and a birthday party for us. We went out for a short trip on the yacht as well. A great place to relax with your family and friends. Highly recommended!"

However, the neighbors were doing some construction work, so we couldn’t sleep until 10 or 11 a.m. It wasn’t the host’s fault, so we didn’t complain. Overall, it was good, but there were only 3 separate bedrooms instead of the 4 mentioned in the description. Still, overall a good experience—I would give it 4 out of 5."

Сам комплекс очень комфортный: внутри есть супермаркет,  массажный салон и множество других удобств, включая кафе, зону отдыха и развлечения на любой вкус.<br/>Особенно понравилось расположение — вокруг масса ресторанов на любой вкус, всё в пешей доступности. Можно каждый день пробовать что-то новое — от свежих морепродуктов до уютных европейских завтраков.<br/>Сами апартаменты чистые, просторные. Всё продумано для комфортного проживания. Очень довольны выбором, рекомендую тем, кто ищет сочетание уюта, удобства и шикарного расположения.<br/>Нужно всего лишь добавить побольше посуды и починить диван.<br/>Отлично отдохнули, спасибо! )"

We wanted a nice place to call home for a month as we weren't planning on a lot of activity.  We loved the homey feeling and decorations....it struck just the right feeling and tone for us.  We also appreciated how clean it was.  The view is wonderful!  Overall, we felt like we picked one of the best options in Nha Trang for our stay.  The location was good....we kind of wished we were closer to the part of town that had a multitude of amazing restaurants to choose from but having said that, there were plenty of good eating options around where we were. We often took a Grab or walked (about 25 minutes) to some of the restaurants we found on google maps. The kitchen was missing a few small items (e.g., coffee maker, wine cork, a good towel for drying after washing) but we found those items easily at the Lotte supermarket so this wasn't really a problem."

Außerdem hat das Badezimmer eine einfach, nicht durchsichtige Tür, was nicht so leicht zu finden ist in Nha Trang, weswegen sich das Apartment super zu zweit nutzen lasst. Das Bett ist groß und gemütlich. Die Küchenausstattung ist in Ordnung. Die Kommunikation war super einfach. Sie hat immer direkt geantwortet und auf alle Umstände reagiert. Der Ausblick ist auch sehr schön."

Nice big clean bathroom, fast internet, very well equipped kitchen, washing machine, space in the balcony to drying clothes, has storage for everything) - will be suitable for a long stay. <br/>Very comfortable to have a shopping mall in the building. Can reach there by not going outside just need to change the lift on parking area. Can get any food there and enjoy your lunch or dinner on the balcony with sea view.<br/>Compare to other apartments this looks more like flat not like a room in the hotel. Therefore, feel much better, relaxed and comfortable when staying in."

Рядом есть русское кафе, а так же много местных кафе. До северного пляжа идти минут 10, там же еще больше больших магазинов, кафе, ресторанчиков. До центра на такси около 50000 донг.

The apartment was spacious and comfortable for 4 persons.  There is a pool on the rooftop which is accessible before 7pm.  You can find some good food around the area too.  If you want to prepare your own restrictive meal due to your diet you can find a morning market and supermarket nearby."

None of that street level mega noise. <br/>It has hotel-grade mattresses - very very comfortable. <br/>We were able to function here for 2 weeks as a family - cooking for our baby, doing laundry - the apartment is sufficiently equipped. <br/>I thought the view was among most iconic you can get - you see Dam market, green hills and mountains, river and see at the same time. Beautiful. <br/>Rooftop pool was mostly empty, so that was great. Kids playroom (if that's your case) was huge benefit. <br/>Everything felt new and it was very clean. No humidity and no bad-smelling wardrobes like in other places."

Location is great with lots of restraints and shops nearby and the sea in ~7 mins walk. Gym is small, but nice. Area with the pool is nice, but keep in mind it is not heated so in winter it is cold. <br/>Highly recommend “Sinh Tố Bi fresh juice” for fresh juices and smoothies (especially strawberry + banana smoothie)<br/>The only minus is that WiFi is ok for basic tasks, but if you have zoom calls it is too weak and you better buy SIM card with internet."

Thi Bich Tram and Nam are very responsive hosts, they were always in touch with me, helped when needed. Such hosts are worth their weight in gold! I felt at home. <br/>I lived in several rooms in the house. The room with a window in the wall is a bit dark, it did not suit me because I spend a lot of time at home because of work. But the room is neat, new and clean. <br/>There is a small market right around the corner, also a store, cafe, embankment nearby, a great beach is a 15-minute walk away, and the climb to Angel Mountain is a 10-minute walk away. The area will suit you if you like peace and quiet, immersion in the life of locals (there are very few tourists), unity with nature. I already miss the house and Nha Trang very much, thank you for this experience!"

The fridge was loud like other guest mention, but didnt bother us at night since we were working or so tired from excursions. The AC did take long to turn on and cool the room, but we just left it on :). The TV did not have any channels or netflix so many this can be added with firestick or similar. Stay there for 7 days the view every morning was beautiful. I would stay here again if I come to nha trang"

The apartment was spacious and clean.Internet was good, AC took a while to start up but was great once on. <br/>The view was beautiful to see the sunrise in the morning. <br/>Hot water for shower was great as was the shower pressure. There were enough amenities, like toothbrush, combs and hair dryer.<br/>Location was central to almost everything and just across the road to the beach with private cabanas available to visitors. <br/>Only downside was that the pool was closed due to renovations, which we were not told of sooner, because we do like to have access to the pool and it was also a selling point at this property. <br/>Also, there was a sensor light by the fridge and it would turn on every time there was movement which actually very annoying.<br/>You have to pay for extra towels during your stay but we did not stay long enough so it worked out well for us. <br/>Would definitely come back and recommend to others. FIX that light please!"

Super convenient with restaurants, cafes, and shops nearby.<br/>The apartment is clean, modern, and well-equipped, but the best part is the balcony. The sea view is stunning! Waking up to the ocean, with a coffee was unforgettable.<br/>Slef Check-in was smooth, and the host was very helpful. Highly recommend for a relaxing Nha Trang getaway!"

Чисто, уютно, есть все необходимое(фен, плита, микроволновка, посуда, чайник, холодильник, телевизор, стиральная машина).  Кондиционер  в каждой комнате. Бассейн на 28 этаже с панорамным видом. Немного прохладная вода, но мы купались. Расположение апартаментов великолепное - море в 7 минутах ходьбы до центрального пляжа. Рядом много разных кафе и магазинов. В пешей доступности рейсовые автобусы для посещения достопримечательностей Нячанга.. Хозяева были на связи, на просьбы отзывались сразу. В целом, очень довольны проживанием и рекомендуем."

There is everything you need, all the necessary dishes and equipment. Each room has air conditioning, TV. A separate floor in the building is occupied by a swimming pool, a gym and a bar.

Лифт ждать долго не приходилось, шумоизоляция достойная. В номере 3 кондиционера. Постельное белье и полотенца идеально чистые. В наличии зубные щетки, паста, шампунь, гель и средство для стирки. Также на кухне есть все необходимое. Вся техника работает исправно. Ни тараканов, ни муравьев в номере нет. До пляжа 5 минут. Также рядом находятся многие интересные кафе. Вид с балкона потрясающий! <br/>Обязательно планируем приехать сюда в следующем году."

Моя дочь была расстроена потому что я ей показывала  Красивые фотографии со свежим ремонтом и мебелью , а на самом деле квартира нуждается в обновлении.  Стены грязные , а не былые .мебель грязная , на диване и стульях сильные пятна , что неприятно садиться . В первой квартире в которую нас заселили кран на раковине в маленькой ванной еле держался . Кухонная посуда грязная , жирная , сковородка тоже , нам пришлось после длинной дороги всё мыть со средством . И даже губка кухонная была старая и вонючая . Стиральная машина есть , но ей не приятно пользоваться , под резинкой грязь . Впечатления очень неприятные . Хорошо , что сняли это жилье только на неделю и вскоре могли уехать оттуда .

Lots of convenience stores, coffee shops, restaurants, massage spas, all within walking distance. Beach is just a few minutes walk or just enjoy the infinity rooftop pool. Complete kitchen with full size refrigerator,  microwave, kitchenware and flatware.  Everything was very clean and welcoming (washing machine too). Quyen was very responsive to all my needs. I hope I get a chance to come back again. Thank you Quyen!"

Hope next time I will have the opportunity to stay for longer, this is a real gem in Nha Trang. It's definitely worth the price, everything in accordance with the description and pictures. The apartment has everything you need, including the washing machine, a space to dry and hangers; a balcony with a seaview, rocky coast view, and at same time central Nha Trang view from 31st floor! Absolutely recommend this accommodation if you're lucky to find it available on your dates"

There’s a great little roadside shop outside the complex that sells everything you might need for super cheap - we went at 23:00 and it was still open. There’s washing machine was very welcome and there detergent to use, also all soaps, sponges etc.  <br/>My only complaints are not the fault of the host, such as the pool being extremely busy at all hours at it serves hundreds of apartments, and Russians shouting in the hallway."

Pool is great option when you get tired of the 5min walk to the beach. Location is good as it is peaceful but close enough to the city centre (10min drive). Would recommend to everyone!!"

It was very suitable for a big family like us. The host answer very quick to our inquiry. The beds were confortable. Every room has airconditioner.Specially I liked the location a lot! It is in the Street that we can feel the local atmosphere, also there were may good restaurant and cafe very close. Supermarket is only 5minute walking. And the City center and many famous spots are close from the accomodation like 5min in grab.  Thanks for great experience!"

But after I sent the gate photo and private massage the driver, it’s not a big deal.<br/>2) We are not familiar with digital lock so first day we are difficult to press on the password and got locked due to attempt too many times. But the host was really supportive, Celine and host will reply us within a minute to guide us how to unlock the digital lock.<br/>3) The water heater was not stable, although the heater was quite new model but it will raise up the temperature after few minutes and you have to lower down the temp again. <br/>Other than that all was super great stay, will strongly recommend my friend if they travel to Nha Trang."

Beautiful view of the ocean, city, and mountains to the west. The value is also incredible and the apartment incredibly clean and well-kept. Highly recommend and thank you so much for letting us stay."

          "comments": "Остались в этой квартире на 10 дней, и я просто в восторге! С самого начала почувствовали себя как дома. Хозяева очень отзывчивые. До всех нужных мест рукой подать, но в то же время квартира находится в тихом уголке, где спокойно и уютно.<br/>Особенно понравился интерьер — видно, что все сделано с любовью, детали продуманы до мелочей. Мне кажется, что здесь невозможно не почувствовать себя комфортно. Кухня полностью оснащена, так что готовить было в радость, а после долгих прогулок по городу приятно было вернуться в такую атмосферную атмосферу.<br/>Безусловно, буду рекомендовать это место друзьям, а сама с удовольствием вернусь в следующий раз!”"

The apartment offers both city and sea views, and being on a high floor, the sunsets are truly breathtaking. It is located away from the crowded Lotte Mart but close enough to reach easily—just a 10-minute walk or a 5-minute Grab ride. However, the master bedroom's toilet occasionally has a sewage smell, and it's necessary to close the bedroom door properly to prevent the odor from spreading into the room."

The room was exactly as described—spotlessly clean and an excellent value for the price. Check-in and check-out were quick and hassle-free, adding to the convenience. Renting a motorbike for just 200k a day made exploring the area so much easier. Highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a comfortable and seamless stay!"

The stunning ocean view from the balcony! Waking up to the sunrise over the sea and falling asleep to the sound of the waves was truly unforgettable. The location is perfect—just a few minutes’ walk to the beach, making it super convenient for a morning swim or a relaxing evening stroll. The surrounding area is lively, with plenty of restaurants and shops nearby, so everything you need is within easy reach. The host was incredibly friendly and responsive, making check-in and check-out smooth and hassle-free. I absolutely loved my stay here, and I’ll definitely be back next time I visit Nha Trang. Highly recommended!"

The two spaces are separated, but if the guest below are super loud you can hear them and I assume code Versa. The host had a car pick from the airport at no charge. That was nice. Chlorine pool, so I would avoid wearing jewelry or cotton clothing as it may discolor them. Overall great place. I would stay again and plan to in the future."

The design is cool, with plenty of natural light in the house. It is also very spacious. But everybody should expect some dust due to the design. Slippers are recommended when walking in the hiuse. More suitable for group of young people. For elders, not so much. The host is very responsive."

And also with hair, long and short and curly one.( the host said it’s the used one and no one complainec b4)<br/>Secondly, the cockroaches that we found in the house much more than we expected. Furthermore, though the cleansing process was provided in the middle of the booking, the house still with live and dead cockroach’s… that’s found the opened ceiling of the 3rd floor bathroom is connected with the 4th floor which is like living in outdoors. That’s the point why so many insects and cockroaches are found (host said we opened the lid and let the cockroach coming,  but its big size as 3inch long)<br/>Thirdly is no privacy of 2nd fl bathroom which is only transparent glass window amd can see from outside directly ( host said its cultural difference. <br/>My two kids have nightmares every night. :("

Plus, the location couldn't be better - it's super close to the city center, which made getting around and exploring local spots so easy.<br/>Each room is cozy and private, so everyone has their own space to unwind. And the amenities? Top-notch. From a fully equipped kitchen to fast Wi-Fi and plenty of entertainment options, everything was there to make the stay comfortable and hassle-free.<br/>But honestly, the highlight of the whole experience was the host.
