The host was also very responsive and helped us out with activities in the city and recommendations around the area. Will definitely come again!"

The apartment was clean, modern, and well-equipped with all the amenities needed for a comfortable stay. The interiors were thoughtfully designed and created a cozy, homely atmosphere.<br/>But the true highlight of our stay was the beautiful. It was the perfect spot to unwind and cool off after a day of exploring the island. Our family spent hours there every day—whether it was enjoying a morning dip, relaxing in the afternoon sun, or taking a peaceful evening swim. It added so much value to our vacation experience.<br/>The location was also great—quiet and peaceful, yet close enough to reach local markets, restaurants, and beaches with ease. The host was extremely responsive and helpful, offering recommendations and ensuring we had a smooth and enjoyable stay.<br/>Highly recommend this property to anyone visiting Phu Quoc."

Посуды достаточно. Холодильник достаточно большой. Интернет работал исправно. Возникающие трудности решались. Был предоставлен байк по хорошей цене. Продуктовые лотки и магазины в шаговой доступности. По острову ходят два рейсовых автобуса, они бесплатные. Очень понравилось, что был фильтр для питевой воды. Бассей большой, неглубокий, чистился регулярно. Имелся мангал. Пляж в 15 минутах ходьбы, бесплатный, чистый, периодически проводилась обработка от насекомых. Данное жилье и хозяина жилья рекомендую. Планирую посетить повторно."

Strolling down the streets, popping into restaurants, and chatting with the local vendors is such a delight. Despite all the hustle and bustle, this place manages to remain peaceful and secluded. Let me tell you, it exceeded all my expectations based on what was described on Airbnb. Everything is so fresh and stylish here."

The view is great - you have a direct view of the clocktower, the evening show with fireworks, the kiss bridge and the sea.  Getting to the start of the gondolas takes about 5 minutes on foot and to the night market takes about 10-15.  The pool is also great with a beautiful view.  The condo itself is nice, bright and modern.  Communication by the host (and her sister) could be improved (we had minor issues at check-in, requests for missing items in the condo and other information were forgotten, etc.), which was a source of minor irritation, but eventually things turned out ok."

Small Swimming pool in lovely setting but not as private as I would have preferred but they planted 2 more trees which will shield from mostly quiet road  when full grown, only 3 neighbours occasionally walk/ ride past. The house is beautiful and spacious, we loved it."

Scooter eller bil er nødvendigt og det tager en 30. min til øens største by. Huset er perfekt, hvis man trænger til afslapning, gå ned i gear og komme væk fra storbyliv. Der er ikke meget at foretage sig, så det skal man være forberedt på.<br/>Vi nød tiden i huset og var super-glade for Thuong som værtinde. Hun er så sød, hjælpsom og imødekommende, en stor anbefaling herfra."

The beaches are long and the sand is soft, the water in the Gulf of Thailand is clear and warm.

There’s a beach club: Saling Club, near this accoms if you want the view of the beach while being in a pool. <br/>But in terms of peaceful and quiet location, this is it,—it’s close to a stretch with food/marts/laundry shop just 5mins ride away. <br/>This place is about 15-20mins ride further up north to the more central part of Phu Quoc where all the shops are. We really like this location cos it’s away from the hustle of the central area and the roads here are a lot quieter too. <br/>In terms of cleanliness, everything is perfect except that a cockroach crawled out from under the curtain on the first night (which we killed). But other than that, everything matches the description and is very neat."

The host was super proactive and the hospitality staff was the friendliest I’ve ever seen - very helpful and mindful. Location is not far from the beach but quite far from the most attractions on the island - you’d need a scooter that you can rent from Su Casa (which was also almost brand new as well). In summary - one of the best stays ever. Thanks!"

The area is being built up, there are very few people, so you can enjoy peace and relaxation. The hotel is stylish and minimalistic. Even in a small room, the kitchen area has been thought out, which has all the necessary utensils. High-quality furniture and pretty clean. A comfortable shower room and good supplies (shampoo, shower gel). The staff is friendly, always ready to help (they helped us get rid of a large bug that flew into the room)). Excellent new bikes can be rented at the hotel, and when booking for seven days or more, a transfer is provided in a comfortable car, which is very useful after a long flight."

          "comments": "This accommodation is new, modern, very clean, good amenities, and a very friendly staff. The location can be a drawback because it’s far from the old part of town where the night market is and most of the tours leave from. If you don’t mind being out by yourself with not much close by you will like this place. It’s very quiet. A little caution is be sure you are booking a one bedroom if that is what you desire. The picture is of a one bedroom unit but when I got there I was in a studio. I asked them and they said that was what I booked. I was looking at the pictures they advertised for the unit and assumed that was what I booked. It was confusing to me. Just pay attention when you book.<br/>I can recommend this place mostly because of the helpful staff. Again, if you want quiet this would be a good choice."

          "comments": "We had a fantastic 5-night stay in this beautifully designed 3-bedroom villa. The villa was spacious, stylish, and spotlessly clean—an ideal setup for our group. Each bedroom featured its own en-suite bathroom, providing both comfort and privacy, while the living and dining areas made it feel like a true home away from home.<br/>A major highlight was the access to the Club facilities was awesome. From the pristine pool and beach club to the excellent on-site dining and wellness amenities, the experience was elevated by the perfect mix of private villa comfort and luxury resort benefits.<br/>The staff were attentive and professional, always happy to assist with anything we needed, including making reservations. Our host was incredibly warm and friendly, and made us feel right at home. Getting around was also easy—Grab rides were readily available, and the host recommended a fantastic seafood restaurant with beautiful sunset just 10 minutes away, which we really enjoyed.<br/>Highly recommended!!!"

The facilities to the resort were great and we enjoyed it very much.<br/>It was a less crowded than what we expected, but it was easy to take a Grab to places we wanted to go to. The check in did not go as well as we would expect. On arrival, parts of the house was dirty and dusty. We were very unhappy with this, but Hoan and his team were truly sorry for this mistake and cleaned the whole house twice. It remained very clean and nice.<br/>Throughout our stay for 7 days, Hoan was very friendly and helpful. The check out went smoothly.<br/>Thank you for having us."

A $15 AUD ride into town in an air conditioned Grab. 800metre walk to the beach. The private pool was heaven. The rooms were beautiful and clean and my son loved the sunken lounge room. The resort pool was amazing too. Book now. You won’t be disappointed."

On top of that, a great host, very helpful and went above and beyond—he bought me a fruit knife when I asked for one and provided additional water and snacks. I booked for a week and ended up staying an additional three days as I enjoyed the beautiful surroundings and the beach with lots of personal space and privacy so much. It allows you a sense of peaceful mindset. This place is very affordable and a bargain for what it offers. Thank you, Khan, for being such a wonderful host, making my holiday in Phu Quoc a very memorable one. I will definitely come back!"

We liked having a kettle and Khan left us some teabags, coffee and little snacks which were a nice touch. The bungalow is on a very beautiful beach and it felt special to wake up to such an incredible view and to be able to watch the sunset from the bungalow. Kind cleaning staff clean the bungalow every day if you want them to. We especially liked that the wifi was very strong and stable and suited to online working. There were no power issues while we were there, even when nearby areas away from the beach were experiencing powercuts. We would stay again for sure. Thank you Khan for your kindness and for being so helpful and friendly!"

Zu Fuss sind einige Restaurants erreichbar. Mit dem Roller ist man schnell und sicher an verschiedenen Orten auf der Insel. <br/>Khan ist ein aussergewöhnlicher Gastgeber. Er hat auf alle Fragen und Anliegen sehr schnell und freundlich reagiert. Die Taxifahrt von und zum Flughafen hat er kostenlos organisiert. Eine tolle Dienstleistung.<br/>Das Bungalow ist geräumig und mit allem Notwendigen ausgestattet. Zu erwähnen ist, dass das Bett ziemlich hart war. Ansonsten haben wie uns rundum wohl gefühlt.

I really love the quietness and the serenity of the place.. the owner also assigned one housekeeper for us along the days. We are staying there whenever we have any problems about the house or anything so this house will always come to us and then solve problems and not only that we also rent a motorbike with the owner and then because one hour motorbike is having some problem than the owner help us to fix it right away. Five star for all of these service and warmness."

The house is super practical: two bedrooms, fully equipped kitchen, TV with Netflix, a great collection of English books, terrace with sofa and a big table (which we later moved inside for late-night laptop work).<br/>You get your own garden and total privacy, just steps from a small private beach.<br/>Next door is Kiki’s, run by Jamie—a warm-hearted guy with food, beers, games, and paddleboards to borrow.<br/>Important: you need a scooter, walking isn’t really an option. But if you have one and want a peaceful, private place—this is it.<br/>Hoang is an amazing host. She arranged a taxi, sent me money when I bought some additional kitchen gear, and speaks English (rare in Phu Quoc). Truly helpful and kind.<br/>Cleaning once a week was another big plus.<br/>Highly recommend. Don’t think twice."

The area is far from all the hustle and bustle, that’s we really like about that location. There only one minus was that the sea at winter time as not so good at this east part of the island. But if you have a bike, then it’s only 30 min drive to the good beaches and the island city center. <br/>Also we are very grateful to Hoang for her hospitality and quick response. She helped us a lot with different moments. <br/>I think this house is a really perfect option for that money, if you wanna live in peaceful area. Highly recommend!"

          "comments": "This house is an amazing find and was great for our family of four.  The house itself is comfortable and well equipped - all the appliances and utensils needed to cook for yourself if you want.  The outdoor seating area is nice. There are mosquitos but they weren't that bad and the host provided mosquito coils. The beach and the chairs in the shade overlooking it are lovely. The water is shallow and often quite calm so good for kids. Trash washes up with the tide but sadly that is the same every where.  The location is secluded and we didn't have motorbikes given the young kids but the kind and super responsive host was great about hooking us up with taxis when we needed them.  There is also a casual and friendly beach hotel next door (Kiki Coconut) which you can reach in a minute by beach or road - it became an extension of the airbnb given how many meals we had at their beach restaurant.  Beautiful location, lovely host, comfortable house, great neighbors - I hope we can return!"

En er zijn niet veel muggen.<br/>Nadeel is wel dat het nogal afgelegen ligt, het kost ruim een half uur om in hoofdstad Duong Dong te komen.

Hoang war zwar nicht vor Ort, hat aber ihre Mitarbeiter/Bekannten vor Ort.<br/>Nebenan ist das Kiki Coconut Beach Resort, das von Jamie, einem Engländer, betrieben wird. Hier gibt es neben lokalen Spezialitäten auch westliches Essen auf der Karte. <br/>Wir waren mit zwei kleinen Kindern vor Ort und es war hervorragend. Tagestouren kosten natürlich extra.

Linh and her mom are very kind hosts; they were always available and helped us solve any issues we had. They also helped us rent a motorbike, which was very good, and we explored the entire island on it. It was very close to Khem Beach and Sao Beach; we got there in just 10 minutes. On the way, we passed by markets and shops where we bought food. We also went to King Kong in Duong Dong for food, which took about 35 minutes to get to. At our villa, there were also two wonderful and friendly dogs; we played with them every evening and became great friends. Thank you for making our stay on Phu Quoc the best!"

They are very sweet and helpful hosts and we haven't met many like them in our last two yrs of traveling. They are just douchy) <br/>I had the wrong number on Lazada but they helped with the delivery and took care of all the issues even though they were under no obligation. <br/>Secondly, this lodge is really cozy and clean. There is everything you need for a comfortable stay for any period.<br/>However, for a fair picture, I am obliged to warn subsequent renters. <br/>We were unfortunately unlucky and there was construction going on at the neighboring property. In Vietnam people wake up very early, so quite noisy works started sometimes at 7 am and lasted all day. This forced us to leave the house, although we had planned to vacation far away from the noisy city. <br/>From this comes a new problem, if you don't have a bike you will have a very hard time in this nei"

One of the best things about this place is its strategic location. It’s situated on the highest point in the area, offering a breathtaking view of the sea and the entire Sunset Town.<br/>The rooftop was definitely a highlight, featuring a beautiful swimming pool where I could relax while enjoying the panoramic view of the city. Every night at 9:30 PM, I was able to watch fireworks from the top floor, which made the experience even more magical.<br/>I would highly recommend Hang’s Place to anyone looking for a scenic, peaceful, and memorable stay."

          "comments": "Wir haben ursprünglich eine andere Villa gebucht, wurden aber aufgrund eines Schadens an der gebuchten Villa in eine brandneue Villa umgebucht. Auch hier zeigte sich schon die gute Kommunikation.<br/>Die Villa war großartig, kleiner Wermutstropfen war einzig und allein der gelegentliche Baulärm gegenüber.<br/>Wir bekamen am Einzugstag eine Ansprechpartnerin, Yi. Und Yi ist ein Goldstück, stets zur Hilfe bei Fragen, und immer erreichbar. Hier reichen keine 5 Sterne, dieser Service verdient 10 Sterne.<br/>Die Klimaanlage im Erdgeschoss war an den ersten Tagen defekt, aber auch hier gab es eine geradlinige Kommunikation und Entgegenkommen, sodass dieser Mangel nicht aufgefallen ist. Wir wurden während des Aufenthalts mit Wasser versorgt, das Arrangieren von Rollern war nur eine Nachricht entfernt und pünktlich früh standen die Roller vor der Tür.<br/>Fazit: Tolles Haus, gute Lage, herausragender Service"

Da vi kom stod det noen klare til å ta oss i mot. Vi leide mopeder og kom oss enkelt rundt. Huset var perfekt for oss som gruppe med oppholdsrom og soverom i forskjellige etasjer. Husene rundt er ikke ferdigstilte og med noe byggebråk rundt, men det var ikke noe som plaget oss."

Но эти нюансы не испортили наш отдых, нам понравилась вилла, её местоположение и бассейн,  возможно вернёмся снова"

You only need to walk for around 10 minutes to the main street and there are some spa nearby.💆🏻‍♀️Vinh Le is a friendly and responsive host:) We are really grateful for the flexible checkin and checkout time he offered! We also want to thanks the house manager Hong To for her kindness and warm gift🤍One thing need to be noted is there are neighborhood dogs that may bark sometimes when you pass by, but this is not a big problem for me. I strongly recommend you to live in this lovely villa for a pleasant journey in Phu Quoc!"

The villa has a high ceiling, spacious living room/bedrooms/outside sitting area, rooftop sitting area with beautiful views, and enough kitchen appliances/glasses/cups for all of us. Loved every minute spent here at this villa. <br/>Also it is secluded with great privacy but at the same time if you walk for 5-6mins it is easily accessible to main road with lots of restaurants. It is also easy to get Grab taxis.<br/>It is a perfect place to stay with a group of friends/family. I will definitely come back! Thank you Vinh for your kindness and prompt response every time!"

However, there was major building work for the first 8 days, with loud noise from 7am to 4pm, which ruined the chance to relax.<br/>After raising it, we were moved to different accommodation, which was bigger but not what we booked, it was separate rooms with shared amenities instead of a private villa.<br/>I also rented a motorbike from the host. The first bike was in poor condition and felt unsafe to ride. No customer should be given a bike like that. The host did replace it, but it added stress.<br/>Communication was functional but often abrupt and uncomfortable.<br/>Overall, there were good points, but the noise, the move, and the motorbike issue significantly impacted our stay."

Als Ausgleich gab uns James eine größere Villa und hat uns kostenlos abgeholt (30 min Fahrt) deswegen können wir die eigentliche Unterkunft nicht bewerten. Die große Villa (3 Schlafzimmer) ist sehr geräumig und sauber. Der Pool ist größer als gedacht. James hat uns bei allem geholfen. Er organisierte uns einen Roller, fuhr uns bei einem Notfall in die Klinik, tätigte Anrufe für uns. Wir haben uns wirklich sehr gut bei ihm gefühlt. Nachdem wir Tage später bemerkt haben, dass wir was in der Villa vergessen haben, hat er uns direkt geantwortet und konnte uns helfen. DANKE JAMES ☺️👍"

There is a large swimming pool, a clean kitchen. and two seasonings, salt and sugar. If you need other seasonings, you can buy them yourself. Diu Xuan replied in time, the team members Kim were very patient, and the communication was smooth. It was very happy to arrange the birthday party perfectly. The only shortcoming of the house is that the sound insulation is bad. At night, we can hear the loud singing and lying down next door. Except for this, everything else is perfect!

It’s also well situated for exploring the island—fairly central, so it was easy to head out in different directions. The villa supervisor kindly helped us arrange scooter hire, which made getting around very convenient.<br/>The villa had everything we needed — comfortable, well-equipped, and kept spotlessly clean. The house was cleaned regularly throughout our stay, and the pool was maintained daily, which we really appreciated.<br/>The resort facilities were excellent, with lovely pools and a well-equipped gym. The host was also fantastic… always quick to respond and very helpful. We’d be more than happy to stay here again."

The communication was seamless and they were kind enough to extend our stay until later that afternoon for a modest fee. The villa is located in a resort complex and you have access to many of the amenities however it’s not immediately clear upfront. For example, you can’t use the Villa app to order room service, rather you order via the host. However, that was only a minor hassle and largely seamless. The facilities in the villa were beautiful just perfect. The location was a bit remote, but the island is so small that it’s easy to get around recommend if you’re a family looking to just hang out and relax for the weekend. Thank you so much for the wonderful day."

The natural backdrop was absolutely breathtaking, and the serene atmosphere made it a perfect getaway. What made the experience truly special, though, was the host. He was incredibly friendly and went above and beyond to help us — when our bike got a puncture, he didn’t hesitate to drive all the way to the city to pick us up. To top it off, he treated us to some delicious home-cooked vegetarian food prepared by his mom — such a generous and warm-hearted family. The property also had a lovely garden that added to the charm. Highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a peaceful retreat with amazing hospitality!"

Das Appartement ist wunderschön und man kann von dem Balkon mit direktem Zugang zum Strand den Sonnenaufgang beobachten. Phong und seine Familie sind super hilfsbereit. Er hat uns beim Mieten eines Rollers unterstützt, uns Tipps für schöne Orte auf der Insel gegeben und sogar für uns gekocht und uns die vietnamesische Kultur etwas näher gebracht. Ich werde mich gerne an unser gemeinsames Abendessen mit vietnamesischem Vodka an Phong zurückerinnern. In unseren 5 Wochen Vietnam Urlaub, war das mit Sicherheit die schönste und lehrreichste Unterkunft! Trotz des vielen Inputs war stets unsere Privatsphäre gewährleistet. Ich würde jederzeit wiederkommen, wenn ich Phu Quoc besuche!<br/>Man muss dazu sagen, dass die Unterkunft, etwas weiter vom \"Geschehen\" entfernt ist. Drumherum gibt es trotzdem einige nette Bars & Resorts um die Zeit zu vertreiben."

Always ready to help and never leaves you in trouble.<br/>The house itself is beautiful and cozy, with a stunning view. Yes, the beach nearby isn’t very clean, but for us, it wasn’t a problem — it actually added a touch of local charm. Being surrounded by locals and nature made the experience even more special.<br/>When you’re around such wonderful people and vibrant places, the little things don’t matter. We truly enjoyed our stay and absolutely recommend it!"

The pool and ocean are really lovely to swim in. <br/>The rooms themselves are large and very tastefully furnished with lovely lightning, bathrooms, and amenities. <br/>Tracy, Polly, and the rest of the staff are very responsive and helpful and ensured that we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. <br/>It is very private and quiet, so if this is what you are after, then Casa D'Elysea is perfect for you. <br/>It was very good value for money. <br/>Thank you for everything."

The seaside view was absolutely stunning and perfect for relaxing mornings and quiet evenings. The host (Tracy) were very responsive and helpful throughout our stay, which made everything even more enjoyable.<br/>The only small issue we encountered was the Wi-Fi connection, which wasn’t very stable at times. However, it didn’t take away from the overall experience. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a peaceful getaway!"

The location is quiet and relaxing, but still close to great attractions like Grand World, VinWonders, Safari, and the night market.<br/>Everything was clean, stylish, and thoughtfully prepared. I highly recommend staying here when visiting Phú Quốc — I’d come back in a heartbeat!"

Very quiet, private beach, gorgeous views, clean water to swim in and a very comfortable room & bed with all the necessary accommodations. The private chef provided delicious options and I found myself eating there for every meal~ I didn’t want to leave this bit of solitude. There is plenty to do within walking distance or for better use of your time take scooters or a grab. I would gladly stay here again!"

Tracy is not only a great host (even before booking when i messaged her, she was attentive, responsive and kind) but a beautiful human being. I am grateful for her and her lovely place. The room is spacious and the view is just stunning. AC works and there's also ceiling fan and desk + there's a massive bath tub in the bath (on top of a nice shower).  Loved it."

The entire town is a masterpiece of European-inspired architecture, and everywhere you look feels like a postcard.<br/>Our stay was nothing short of wonderful. Flora, our lovely host, was incredibly warm and thoughtful—she even gifted me a beautiful brooch as a token of affection. The room was spacious, the bathroom spotless, and the kitchen had everything we needed for a comfortable stay.<br/>Need a bike? Flora will sort it out for you in no time!<br/>It felt less like a hotel, more like a warm, welcoming home.<br/>Can’t recommend it enough—this place is a gem!"

They even provide new sponge for cleaning. Steam iron and hair dryer works well too. It was located at a new place but near to attractions. Host’s dogs and neighbours are too friendly but we are afraid of dogs so it was quite difficult to go in and out but the host and husband are very helpful. They help us get in and out of the house safely. They even provide few services like motor rent, car rent and etc. overall, it was a pleasant stay. We enjoyed staying here ☺️<br/>Thank you for the gift too 🤩🤩"

From the moment we arrived, Flora was an incredibly welcoming and thoughtful host, making us feel right at home. The room is part of a charming, family-run hotel located just a short walk from Sunset Town and the night market—perfect for exploring the area on foot.<br/>Everything we needed was provided, and having access to a washing machine was a huge plus during our travels. Flora went above and beyond with her local recommendations, making it easy for us to discover the best of the island.<br/>One of the highlights was being able to watch the nightly fireworks from the rooftop—a perfect solution for my daughter, who prefers to enjoy them from a distance without the loud noise.<br/>We would absolutely stay here again and highly recommend Little Phu Quoc for its comfort, convenience, and warm hospitality."

The host was very helpful with organizing transport to airport. 15minutes to closest beaches, ways less fot restaurand and bar options. We recommend the place!"

She thoughtfully asked about our flight schedule to prepare everything in advance—like turning on the air conditioning and providing detailed transportation tips.  <br/>Upon arrival, we were impressed by how clean and well-equipped the place was. Complimentary water, a fully stocked kitchen (great for long stays!), a free washing machine, and even a coffee maker made our stay so comfortable.  <br/>The location was ideal—right in the center, just a 100m walk to the beach, with motorbike rentals nearby. Everything was simply perfect. Love this place!"
